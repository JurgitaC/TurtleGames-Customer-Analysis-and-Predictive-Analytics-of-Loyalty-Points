## ❓ Business Questions: 

To improve sales performance, Turtle Games has posed set of questions: 
- How do customers engage with and accumulate loyalty points?
- How can customers be segmented into groups for targeted marketing?
- How can customer reviews be used to inform marketing campaigns and make improvements to the business?
- Are loyalty points suitable data to create predictive models?

----------------------

## 🫚 Data Source
The file *turtle_reviews.csv* was used in the analysis. It contained limited customer information—such as age, education level, income, and loyalty points—as well as product identifiers and corresponding customer reviews.

----------------------

## ⚙️ Analytical Approach 

- To **investigate which factors influence loyalty points accumulation** through
a multi-method analysis: MLR and Decision Tree Regressor were applied in Python, with key
findings cross-validated in R, the company’s preferred language.

- **Customer segmentation** was performed using K-Means clustering to support targeted marketing.

- Basic text preprocessing and lexicon-based sentiment models (VADER, TextBlob) were applied to customer reviews to
demonstrate **the potential of leveraging sentiment insights for better decision-making**.
